        <p>
            Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so you understand what is permissible in our programming projects. Any case of academic dishonesty will be referred to the <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/">University's Office of
                Student Conduct</a>. Please don't post your code online where others can see your code.
        </p>

        <div class="h4">Overview</div>
        <p>
            For this project you will implement a system called "Terp Store." The system allows users to inquire about store items and to submit orders. You will define two forms for users to
            submit data. A video showing some of the system functionality can be found at
            <a href="https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cd1d6716-acc8-4e81-9c42-ae4400eea998">Application Video</a>. Feel free to answer project questions in Piazza if you know the answer to them; we welcome those answers.
        </p>

        <p>The project's code distribution is available at the directory projects/projects2/TerpStore inside
            of your repo (after you have pulled in the changes from upstream). The contents of the TerpStore directory
            are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>index.shtml</strong> - This is the main page of the application with links to
                the catalogInquiry.shtml and the placingOrder.shtml pages.
            </li>
            <li><strong>catalogInquiry.shtml</strong> - This page includes a form for users to ask
                for items' information.</li>
            <li><strong>placingOrder.shtml</strong> - This page includes a form that allow users to submit
                an item's order.</li>
            <li><strong>footer.shtml</strong> - This is a footer that you must include in the other pages
                using a server side include directive.</li>
            <li><strong>style.css</strong> - All style information will be present in this file.</li>
            <li><strong>images</strong> - A folder for images.</li>

            <strong>placingOrder.shtml</strong> page.
            Define HTML and CSS to recreate the page you see in the image

            close to what you see in the image, you are OK (it does not need to be exact). The requirements

                be <strong>brown</strong>, and <strong>beige</strong> once a link has been visited.
